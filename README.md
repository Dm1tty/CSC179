# CSC179 Healthcare Project
## Prerequisites
- Latest NPM/Node.js
## Resources
### External Documentation
- [React Native Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/)
    - Look here if you want to learn more about setting up the project w/ emulation in Android Studio, building the app to executables for your target platform, and other info related to building and running the app.
- [Expo Docs - SDK](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/)
    - Documentation of Expo components/API functions. Would highly recommend looking through this list, there are a lot of useful functions for interacting w/ the file system, camera, etc. that are not included with React Native by default, as well as custom components not included with React Native either.
